## CS:GO - ZywOo is number 1

Frenchman Mathieu "ZywOo" Herbaut from Team Vitality has been voted the best CS:GO player of the year. This makes him the youngest title holder of all time.

The young French superstar Mathieu "ZywOo" Herbaut is impossible to get past at the moment. The 20-year-old AWPer from Team Vitality shines with an outstanding statistic and was therefore quite rightly voted Player of the Year by HLTV.
The youngest winner ever

At just 20-years-old, ZywOo wins the coveted award for the second time. Only two other players have also managed this feat. Marcelo "coldzera" David was named best CSGO player in 2016 and 2017, while the recently retired Christopher "GeT_RiGhT" Alesund was awarded the title in 2013 and 2014.

In 2019, ZywOo won the award at the age of 19, becoming the youngest winner ever. In 2020, his stats were challenged only by Na'Vis Aleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev, who, however, collected fewer MVP awards and trophies. "Receiving this honor for another year feels like a dream, especially after this challenging season," ZywOo explains. "Playing CS:GO was everything I ever wanted. I'm very grateful to my team members and Vitality and hope to make them proud again in 2021." Vitality recently extended ZywOo's contract for another five years.
